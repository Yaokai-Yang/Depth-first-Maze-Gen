# Depth-first Maze Generator
 A recursive implementation of randomized depth-first maze generation.
 Every part of the generated maze is connect in some way. As such, no start or end point is designated.

# Note
 The builds generate a 50x50 maze
 However, running the source code in Processing with similar sizes may result in a stackoverflow error due to too many recursions.
